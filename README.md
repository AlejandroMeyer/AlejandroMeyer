## Hi, I'm Alejandro Meyer ContrerasðŸ‘‹

Everyone calls me Meyer, I'm an economist and I like data.
I love learning new things and challenges are a passion for me. Any time is a good time to accept new challenges.
I'm interested in data analysis and all its science but software development is also welcome. 



**Talking about me**

Economics allows me to understand the social context and thanks to programming I can represent it in a better way for everyone.
I am constantly learning about new technologies as well as process improvement. In the near future AI will help society more, we must be prepared for the change!

*Always remember: Data is the most important asset and the knowledge is for everyone!*
